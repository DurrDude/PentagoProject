# PentagoProject

This is a project for my Artificial Intelligence class where the objective was to create the best heuristic for an artificial intelligence to play Pentago.
<br>A quick video on how to play Pentago can be found here: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DgUsC_X0QI**

The heuristic won **third place** in a class-wide tournament against 57 other entries.

Skeleton code was designed by Professor Jeffrey Popyack.
<br>Heuristic, MiniMax, Monte Carlo graphsearch, and playout functions were created by me. Also, small changes were done to the skeleton code to help integrate with my changes.
<br>

Try playing a game against it to see if you could defeat the heuristic!
