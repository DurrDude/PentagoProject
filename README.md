# PentagoProject

This is a project for my Artificial Intelligence class where we had to create the best heuristic for an artificial intelligence to play Pentago
A quick video on how to play Pentago can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DgUsC_X0QI

The heuristic won third place in a class-wide tournament against 57 other entries.

Skeleton code was designed by Professor Jeffrey Popyack.
Heuristic, MiniMax, Monte Carlo graphsearch, and playout functions were created by me. Also, small changes were done to the skeleton code to help integrate with my changes.
